#  Dependency injection (DI)
Dependency injection (DI) is a process whereby 
objects define their dependencies (that is, the 
other objects with which they work) only through 
constructor arguments, arguments to a factory 
method, or properties that are set on the object 
instance after it is constructed or returned from 
a factory method.

## Description

This project shows the implementation of dependency
injection using Constructor method, Setter method,
and Field method.
- The **UserService** class shows the implementation of the 
dependency injection using **Field Method**.
- The **ProductService Class** shows the 
implementation of dependency injection using the
**Constructor method**.
- The **CategoryService class** shows the 
implementation of dependency injection using the 
**Setter method**.
